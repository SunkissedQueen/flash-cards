# Flashcards Application: React Frontend with Rails API  
***Phase 1: React Application with Mock Data***  
---

## Introduction
Welcome to my Flashcards Application! This project aims to enhance a user's learning experience through the app's dynamic platform to create, manage, and study flashcards for terms, definitions, and multiple-choice questions.

## Features  
***Phase 1: React Application with Mock Data, displaying static data***  
- **Dynamic Flashcards**: Create and manage flashcards with ease.
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, delete flashcards to customize your study materials.
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Enhance your learning with interactive multiple-choice questions.
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Utilizes a React frontend with a Ruby on Rails backend API, promoting scalability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install frontend dependencies using Yarn.
   ```
   cd flashcard-app
   yarn
   ```

3. **Start React App**: Run the following command to start the React frontend.
   ```
   yarn start
   ```  

***Phase 1: React Application with Mock Data, No Rails App Available yet, Steps 4 -5 not relevant***
4. **Set Up Rails API**: Navigate to the `api` directory and install Rails dependencies.
   ```
   cd ciat-flashcards-api
   bundle
   ```

5. **Start Rails Server**: Start the Rails API server.
   ```
   rails server
   ```

## Usage  
***Phase 1: React Application with Mock Data, Only crud action available is read.***  
- Access the application through your browser.
- Begin by exploring existing flashcards or creating new ones.
- Utilize CRUD operations to manage your flashcards.
- Test your knowledge with interactive multiple-choice questions.
